Pokemon Red Colorized Plus
Includes Debug Menu
Gender Selection
Running Shoes
Facing NPC Script
and more

the debug version has an cheat built in using the select button in the title screen
the non version does not include this function

Requires rgbds v0.4.2
github.com gbdev/rgbds.git
git checkout v0.4.2
make

either link to or install
sudo make install

I may end up putting an installer in this like I did for version 1
